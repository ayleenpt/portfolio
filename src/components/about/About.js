          Iâ€™ve had separate passions for creativity and mathematics since I was old enough to understand those concepts. In college I discovered software development as a conjunction between the two, leveraging my creative ability and logical thinking skills to excel academically and professionally. I completed a six month internship as a backend engineer in 2024, developing my confidence with full scale development and preparing me for a career in tech. I enjoy creating art with my engineering skills through making fun, interactive web apps that demonstrate my technical and artistic abilities. I will graduate from the University of Washington in June 2025, and I look forward to beginning my career as a software engineer.

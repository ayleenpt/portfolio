The result features a custom algorithm designed to analyze and counter every possible user move, ensuring that the game always ends in either a draw or a win in the computerâ€™s favor. I also created custom graphics to play the game on a box of mochi, with flour dustings to represent an X or an O. If you manage to beat my algorithm, you can let me know through the contact form on my About page!";

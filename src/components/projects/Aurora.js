  const description = "Aurora features a night sky with twinkling stars that react to the movements of the mouse. Bringing the stars behavior to life was challenging, but through many cycles of research, trial, and iteration, I achieved the interactive effect I had imagined, even adding interesting effects for when the mouse is still. I optimized the siteâ€™s performance by minimizing re-renders and streamlining the animations that create the twinkling effect, leading to a simpler and more efficient final product. Aurora was a rewarding challenge that remains a flexible project, with room for me to continue building off of and improving as I develop my talents.";
